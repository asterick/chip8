                       LOOPZ48 ver 1.1  by Andreas Daumann
                       -----------------------------------



Hey HP-Freaks and Fans,

 well I brought you another hot game for the great HP48 handheld computer.
Do you know LOOPZ? It's also realized on PC, AMIGA and GAMEBOY. It's based
on a nice idea which remembers on TETRIS or PIPEMANIA. If you like this little
game please write me a postcard or some other gift (money for example)
from your country, I would be very pleased. The address stands at the
end of the document.

Notes: - This game was written in USR-RPL and SChip V1.1 (main part!)
       - Thanks to E. Bryntse for SCHIP V1.1,  A. Gustafsson for CHIP48
         and Chr. Egeberg for (S)Chip Assembler V2.11.
       - This program is public domain (anyway send me a gift!)
       - First I wanted to write more features (Bonus rounds, more graphics
         etc.) but the 4KB limit of SCHIP programs stopped my enthusiasm.
         I'm sorry maybe I write the second version in ML.
	   - loopz48s is for HP48S and loopz48g for ... guess it
	   - for HP48G only: you need the library schiplib.gx

II. Playing
--- -------

[LOOPZ48] starts the game. Press any key to continue (DEL = quit).
Select level using [1] [2] and [5] to go on. The game will start.

Keys:

Left  : 1       Right  : 2
Up    : /       Down   : *
Turn  : 6       Drop/OK: 5
Sound : +/-     Quit   : DEL or ENTER

You have three lifes, you lose one life if the time is out.
                                 ÉÍÍ»
Try to build loops. For example: º  ÈÍ» then the loop will be erased.
                                 ÈÍÍÍÍ¼
If you are lucky you get a 'Scratcher' like this one 'o'. Then you can
delete bad tries.

The higher the level, the faster the game and the more points you get.

At the end the whole gamematrix will be erased and the more tiles are on
the board the more points you get.
